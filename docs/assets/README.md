# Assets for docs and README

- **Porter (mascot):** Use SVGs and the interactive playground from [APort Brand — Meet Porter](https://aport.io/brand-mascot-agent/). You can download the page or copy the mascot SVGs for use in docs or the main README.
- **Demo GIF:** Add a short GIF here (e.g. `porter-demo.gif` or `guardrail-demo.gif`) showing:
  - Terminal: one ALLOW and one DENY from the guardrail, or
  - Plugin config + passport snippet, or
  - Porter verifying a command (from the brand page).
  Then reference it in the root README, e.g. `![Demo](docs/assets/porter-demo.gif)`.
