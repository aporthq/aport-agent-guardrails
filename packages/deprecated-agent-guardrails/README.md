# @aporthq/agent-guardrails [DEPRECATED]

> ⚠️ **This package has been renamed to `@aporthq/aport-agent-guardrails`**

## Migration

This package has been renamed for better SEO and discoverability.

**Old:**
```bash
npm install @aporthq/agent-guardrails
npx @aporthq/agent-guardrails
```

**New:**
```bash
npm install @aporthq/aport-agent-guardrails
npx @aporthq/aport-agent-guardrails
```

## What This Package Does

This is a **compatibility wrapper** that forwards to the new package. It will show a deprecation warning and then execute the new package.

**All functionality is identical** - this is just a renamed package.

## Timeline

- **Now**: This wrapper allows existing users to continue using the old name
- **Future**: This package will be unpublished once adoption of the new name is complete
