# ShellCheck configuration for APort Agent Guardrails
# See: https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/

# Enable all optional checks
enable=all

# Disable specific checks (with justification)

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# Justification: We use dynamic sourcing based on framework detection
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced file
# Justification: Some sourced files may not exist in all environments
disable=SC1091

# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Justification: Some variables are exported for child processes or sourced scripts
# disable=SC2034  # Keep this enabled to catch actual unused variables

# SC2064: Use single quotes to prevent glob expansion
# Justification: We sometimes intentionally want expansion in traps
# disable=SC2064  # Keep this enabled for safety

# Severity levels to report (error, warning, info, style)
# We want to catch all issues
# severity=warning

# Shell dialect
# Default: auto-detect, but we primarily use bash
shell=bash

# Source path for resolving sourced files
# source-path=SCRIPTDIR

# External sources (if any)
